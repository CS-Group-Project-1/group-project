    # Candlestick Chart Explanation
    st.markdown("""
    ## Understanding Candlestick Charts
    Candlestick charts represent the price movement of a cryptocurrency over a specific timeframe.
    For instance:
    - **1D (1 Day)**: Each candlestick represents the price data for one day.
    - **1H (1 Hour)**: Each candlestick represents one hour of trading.

    ### How a Candlestick is Formed:
    - **Open Price**: The price at which the asset started trading in the given timeframe.
    - **Close Price**: The price at which the asset finished trading in the given timeframe.
    - **High Price**: The highest price reached in the timeframe.
    - **Low Price**: The lowest price reached in the timeframe.

    Below is a visual explanation of a candlestick structure:

    # Technical Details Section

    ## Technical Details
    Easy2Trade uses a **Machine Learning (ML) Model** to provide personalized recommendations based on user feedback. 
    Hereâ€™s how the process works:
    1. **User Feedback**: When you like or dislike a coin, this feedback is recorded and influences future recommendations.
    2. **Attributes Considered**:
       - **Volatility**: Measures price fluctuations.
       - **Average Volume**: Tracks the average amount traded.
       - **Trends**: Classifies patterns like "Upward", "Downward", or "Stable".
    3. **Prediction of Unrated Coins**: The ML model calculates scores for unrated coins and ranks them for suggestions.
